Boosty: The Ultimate University Learning Platform (Now with Weekly Quizzes & Smart Project Matching)

Project Overview Boosty is an all-in-one academic ecosystem that:

üìä Gives Professors Real-Time Class Understanding (Lecture Pulse)

‚úçÔ∏è Automatically Organizes Study Materials (AI Notes)

ü§´ Keeps Students Focused & Accountable (Silent Study Squads)

üéØ Assesses Weekly Progress (Auto-Generated Quizzes)

üë• Creates Perfect Project Teams (Smart Matching)

Target Users: Students, Professors, Study Groups Platforms: Mobile (iOS/Android) + Desktop (Windows/macOS)

Detailed Feature Breakdown

1.‚Å† ‚Å†Lecture Pulse ‚Äì Real-Time Class Feedback Problem Solved: Professors often don‚Äôt know students are struggling until exams.

How It Works:

During lectures, students tap:

üòï (Confused) / ü§î (Unsure) / üéØ (Got It!)

Professors see a live heatmap overlaid on slides:

python #Sample confusion alert if confusion_percentage > 60%: alert_professor("Slide 12: 68% students confused") Post-lecture: "Top 3 Questions" are published for review.

Unique Tech:

Optional IoT buttons (Bluetooth) for tactile feedback.

Firebase Realtime DB for instant updates.

2.‚Å† ‚Å†Automated Lecture Notes & AI Highlights Problem Solved: Students waste time organizing messy notes.

How It Works:

Records lectures ‚Üí AI (Whisper + GPT-4) generates:

Summaries

Flashcards

Key concept tags

Auto-tags confusing sections using Lecture Pulse data.

Example Output:

[Week 5: Recursion]
‚ö†Ô∏è Confusion Peak (72% students): Base cases
‚úÖ Strong Understanding: Recursive calls

3.‚Å† ‚Å†Silent Study Squads Problem Solved: Group chats become distracting.

How It Works:

Students join focus squads for their course.

No chatting‚Äîjust:

Live progress bars ("3/5 working")

Pomodoro battles (compete in 25-min sprints)

Unlock group rewards (e.g., meme packs).

Tech: WebSockets for real-time sync.

4.‚Å† ‚Å†Weekly Pop-Up Quizzes(NEW) Problem Solved: No way to measure weekly progress.

How It Works:

Every Friday, 10-question quiz on that week‚Äôs topics.

Questions prioritize high-confusion areas from Lecture Pulse.

Instant grading + explanations.

Professor Insights:

json "quizzes/CS101/week5": { "avg_score": 68%, "weakest_topic": "Pointers (52% accuracy)" }

5.‚Å† ‚Å†Smart Project Matching (NEW) Problem Solved: Mismatched group members in team projects.

How It Works:

Groups students by quiz performance brackets:

A (85-100%) | B (70-84%) | C (50-69%) | etc.

Suggests 3 ideal partners based on:

Similar skill level

Complementary strengths

Same class group (e.g., AI01)

Example Match:

[ Kayra (AI01) - 85% ]
‚Üí Suggested: Irmak (AI03, 90%)
‚Ä¢ Both strong in algorithms
‚Ä¢ Different class groups ‚Üí encourages networking
Technical Architecture Frontend Mobile: Flutter (iOS/Android)

Desktop: Electron (Windows/macOS)

Backend Realtime DB: Firebase

AI Services: OpenAI API + Custom Python NLP

Analytics: Pandas/Matplotlib

Special Hardware IoT Buttons: Raspberry Pi + BLE for tactile feedback

Why This Stands Out ‚úÖ Closes the Loop

Confusion detected ‚Üí Better notes ‚Üí Quiz focus ‚Üí Perfect teams

‚úÖ Balances Social + Academic

Silent squads for focus

Matching for collaboration

‚úÖ Hardware/Software Blend

Physical buttons for engagement

AI for personalized learning

Next Steps MVP Priorities:

Lecture Pulse + Quiz system (core analytics)

Basic matching algorithm

Demo Flow:

Show real-time lecture feedback ‚Üí Quiz results ‚Üí Team suggestions

Potential Expansions:

AR textbook annotations

Alumni mentorship matching

Final Pitch "EduSync Pro is like if Google Docs, Duolingo, and LinkedIn had a baby‚Äîdesigned purely to help universities teach better and students learn smarter."
